# TatakaeBot
TatakeBot, a motivational bot that aims to uplift users when they are feeling demotivated. It identifies keywords like "unhappy," "sad," or "low" within user messages. Upon detecting these keywords, TatakeBot responds with words of encouragement, offering support and motivation to help users regain their positivity. I developed this functionality using Node.js and Discord.js.
